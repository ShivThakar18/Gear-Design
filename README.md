# ENGINEER-1C03-Design-Project
This project outlines the design for a low-cost gripping apparatus for an advanced prosthetic for BME Devices. The apparatus is designed to be a full right hand, with working/moving fingers. 
## Design Parameters
- Apply an input speed of 67 RPM using a gearing mechanism
- Reduce the rotational rate of the finger and thumb to 15 RPM
- The mechanism should be designed so that the forefingers and thumb rotate in opposite directions
- The design should include a bracket which supports the gears but does not interfere with the provided prosthetic frame
## Our Design
We designed our mechanism to be composed of 14 spur gears, which were given an input speed of 67 RPM to 15.033 RPM
## Gear Calculations
Input Speed = 67 RPM

Desired Output Speed = 15 RPM +- 0.075 RPM

Achieved Output Speed = 15.033 RPM

Gear Ratio = 67 / 15 = 4.46667

Gear A: 20 Teeth, 67 RPM.

Gear B: 28 Teeth, 47.857 RPM

Gear C: 14 Teeth, 47.857 RPM

Gear D: 24 Teeth, 27.917 RPM

Gear E: 14 Teeth, 15.033 RPM
